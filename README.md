Welcome to the world of the past!

This demonstration has a number of unique features in an attempt to simulate the feel of a bygone era:

 * The command prompt has an old-timey blinkey cursor and text feel.
 * There's now a virtual filesystem! And virtual executables!
 * There's a cute immitation Start menu.
 * The web browser sends URL requests to the past (~1999) via archive.org.
 * The CD player plays CD-quality music graciously permitted for use here by </body> (https://bodyendtag.bandcamp.com/album/initializing).
 * Notepad!

 Please feel free to look around and explore. Thank you for visiting!
